So basically, I need to implement a few things:
    1. Primary Energy System/Glycolysis - Body uses ingested glucose from food.
    
    1.5 Liver Glycolysis - Body uses glycogen from the liver.
    
    2. Auxiliary Energy System/Ketosis - Body breaks down stored fat.
    Doing too much of this will lead to ketoacidosis.
    
    3. Muscle breakdown (myosis?) - Body breaks down muscle tissue. Doing too
    much of this will lead to severe atrophy of the muscles.
    
    4.Hormones - Effect how energy is used.
